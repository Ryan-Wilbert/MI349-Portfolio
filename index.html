            <p class="bio_text_1">Hi there! I'm Ryan Wilbert, a student at Michigan State University studying Information Science. I am a passionate artist and researcher (currently) interested in how we can best use technology to handle the spread of information in society.<br><br>I come from Lake Orion, Michigan, and I have lived in the state for my whole life. The Midwest has influenced most of it — from my music taste to my general personality.<br><br>My hobbies include drawing, reading, writing, and creating music with my two guitars. I like to consider myself a hard working person, and with a quick browse of my work, I hope you can conclude the same.
